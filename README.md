# UFO Sightings Website

## Overview
Working with a client named “Dana” we were tasked with helping her build a website that could search through a large data set of UFO sightings. The website needed to be dynamic and appeal to individuals visiting the site.

### Resources
** JavaScript, HTML
** Using VSCode

## Results
The result of working with Dana was the creation of a dynamic website. Users can filter on any combination of date, city, state, country, and UFO shape. The website contains “placeholders” so that the user can see the format required to enter their search criteria. Upon hitting “Enter” the results are displayed. 

The screen shot below shows and example of a filtered list. In this example only the state of Texas was searched. The other information displayed in the filters are the placeholders. This is a deficiency that needs to be addressed in the next version of the website. The color of the text input and that of the placeholders is the same and causes confusion.

## Summary
In all, the website is a success, but has several glaring examples of needed upgrades. The placeholders need to be a different color than the actual text that is entered by the user as well as disappear once a user inputs their own search criteria. Another issue is the need for a “filter” button. Some users might not know to hit “Enter” in order to search. The final upgrade would be to search multiple criteria per search box. Right now if a user wants to search for UFO’s in Texas and New Mexico, they have to conduct two searches instead of just one. <br/>

**Recommendations**
1. Display the placeholders in a different color than the user entered text.
2. Add a filter button.
3. Allow multiple search criteria for each search box
